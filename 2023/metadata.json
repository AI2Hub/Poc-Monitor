{"CVE-2023-22809":{"Published":"2023-01-18T17:15:00","summary":"In Sudo before 1.9.12p2, the sudoedit (aka -e) feature mishandles extra arguments passed in the user-provided environment variables (SUDO_EDITOR, VISUAL, and EDITOR), allowing a local attacker to append arbitrary entries to the list of files to process. This can lead to privilege escalation. Affected versions are 1.8.0 through 1.9.12.p1. The problem exists because a user-specified editor may contain a \"--\" argument that defeats a protection mechanism, e.g., an EDITOR='vim -- /path/to/extra/file' value."},"CVE-2023-22960":{"Published":"2023-01-23T21:15:00","summary":"Lexmark products through 2023-01-10 have Improper Control of Interaction Frequency."},"CVE-2023-23488":{"Published":"2023-01-20T18:15:00","summary":"The Paid Memberships Pro WordPress Plugin, version \u003c 2.9.8, is affected by an unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability in the 'code' parameter of the '/pmpro/v1/order' REST route."},"CVE-2023-24055":{"Published":"2023-01-22T04:15:00","summary":"** DISPUTED ** KeePass through 2.53 (in a default installation) allows an attacker, who has write access to the XML configuration file, to obtain the cleartext passwords by adding an export trigger.
