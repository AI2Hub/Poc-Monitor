## CVE-2023-22551 (2023-01-01T18:15:00)
> The FTP (aka "Implementation of a simple FTP client and server") project through 96c1a35 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by engaging in client activity, such as establishing and then terminating a connection. This occurs because malloc is used but free is not.

## CVE-2023-22451 (2023-01-02T16:15:00)
> Kiwi TCMS is an open source test management system. In version 11.6 and prior, when users register new accounts and/or change passwords, there is no validation in place which would prevent them from picking an easy to guess password. This issue is resolved by providing defaults for the `AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS` configuration setting. As of version 11.7, the password can’t be too similar to other personal information, must contain at least 10 characters, can’t be a commonly used password, and can’t be entirely numeric. As a workaround, an administrator may reset all passwords in Kiwi TCMS if they think a weak password may have been chosen.
