## CVE-2021-44228 (2021-12-10T10:15:00)
> Apache Log4j2 2.0-beta9 through 2.15.0 (excluding security releases 2.12.2, 2.12.3, and 2.3.1) JNDI features used in configuration, log messages, and parameters do not protect against attacker controlled LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints. An attacker who can control log messages or log message parameters can execute arbitrary code loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup substitution is enabled. From log4j 2.15.0, this behavior has been disabled by default. From version 2.16.0 (along with 2.12.2, 2.12.3, and 2.3.1), this functionality has been completely removed. Note that this vulnerability is specific to log4j-core and does not affect log4net, log4cxx, or other Apache Logging Services projects.

## CVE-2021-42697 (2021-11-02T22:15:00)
> Akka HTTP 10.1.x before 10.1.15 and 10.2.x before 10.2.7 can encounter stack exhaustion while parsing HTTP headers, which allows a remote attacker to conduct a Denial of Service attack by sending a User-Agent header with deeply nested comments.

## CVE-2021-41773 (2021-10-05T09:15:00)
> A flaw was found in a change made to path normalization in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49. An attacker could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives. If files outside of these directories are not protected by the usual default configuration "require all denied", these requests can succeed. If CGI scripts are also enabled for these aliased pathes, this could allow for remote code execution. This issue is known to be exploited in the wild. This issue only affects Apache 2.4.49 and not earlier versions. The fix in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.50 was found to be incomplete, see CVE-2021-42013.

## CVE-2021-38314 (2021-09-02T17:15:00)
> The Gutenberg Template Library & Redux Framework plugin <= 4.2.11 for WordPress registered several AJAX actions available to unauthenticated users in the `includes` function in `redux-core/class-redux-core.php` that were unique to a given site but deterministic and predictable given that they were based on an md5 hash of the site URL with a known salt value of '-redux' and an md5 hash of the previous hash with a known salt value of '-support'. These AJAX actions could be used to retrieve a list of active plugins and their versions, the site's PHP version, and an unsalted md5 hash of siteâ€™s `AUTH_KEY` concatenated with the `SECURE_AUTH_KEY`.

## CVE-2021-3560 (2022-02-16T19:15:00)
> It was found that polkit could be tricked into bypassing the credential checks for D-Bus requests, elevating the privileges of the requestor to the root user. This flaw could be used by an unprivileged local attacker to, for example, create a new local administrator. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.
